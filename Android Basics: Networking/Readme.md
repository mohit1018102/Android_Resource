# Json Parsing

1. **API: Application Programming Interface :** Application programming interfaces, or APIs, simplify software development and innovation by enabling applications to exchange data and functionality easily and securely.
2. An application programming interface, or API, enables companies to open up their applicationsâ€™ data and functionality to external     third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies.

## Json Overview
1. JSON stands for **JavaScript Object Notation.**
2. JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format.
3. JSON is plain text written in JavaScript object notation.
4. JSON is used to send data between computers.
5. JSON is **language independent**

### JSON Syntax Rules
* JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax:
1. Data is in name/value pairs
2. Data is separated by commas
3. Curly braces hold objects
4. Square brackets hold arrays

### JSON object
* JSON objects are written inside curly braces.
```json
   {
       "firstName":"John", 
       "lastName":"Doe"
    }
```

### JSON Arrays
* JSON arrays are written inside square brackets.
``` json
   {
     "company":"xyz",                                             //json primitive
     "employees":[                                                // json array
                     {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
                     {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},    // json object
                     {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
                  ]
   }
```
### Nested JSON OBJECT
```json
    {
        "name": "xyz",                                             //json primitive
        "other": {                                                 // json object
                     "details": [
                                   {"data":"a","data":"b"},        
                                   {"data":"a","data":"b"},        
                                   {"data":"a","data":"b"},
                                   {"data":"a","data":"b"}         
                                  ],
                      "xyz": "abc"                                   //json primitive
                  }
      }
```
