# Navigation Patterns in Android
1. **Navigation guides users between different parts of your app.**
      * **Simple Navigation** layout holding list of data. when you  click on the data ,a detailed data view of item appears.
      * **Navigation Drawer** layout holding list of data on side drawer, when you  click on the data ,a detailed data view of item appears.
      * **swipeable tabs** You can swipe horizontally left and right between different screens, or you can tap one of the tabs across the top of the screen. ex: youtube

5.  **Refactor code : perform changes without breaking the existing functionalities.**
6.  **Regression  : meaning : developed to less developed state:** When you break something, and the user loses the ability to do something in the app 
    compared to earlier versions, this is called regression

# Fragment 
**A fragment is just a part of an activity. You can have a fragment that takes up part of a screen or a whole screen. Or you can show multiple fragments at the 
same time to make up a whole screen. Within an activity, you can also swap out different fragments with each other.**
